## Executive Summary

On January 3, 2026, the United States executed **Operation Absolute Resolve**, capturing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. This operation fundamentally transformed Western Hemisphere geopolitics and triggered an existential energy crisis in Cuba.

### Key Developments

- **Venezuelan Leadership**: Delcy Rodríguez sworn in as acting president (January 5, 2026)
- **US Strategy**: Implementation of the "Donroe Doctrine" - 21st-century Monroe Doctrine focused on energy resource control
- **Cuban Impact**: Complete cessation of Venezuelan oil shipments (26,500-35,000 BPD), creating 18-20 hour daily blackouts
- **Economic Leverage**: US control over world's largest oil reserves through institutional management framework

---

## Operation Absolute Resolve

### Mission Parameters

**Date**: January 3, 2026  
**Official Justification**: Law enforcement operation under Presidential constitutional authority to apprehend indicted narcoterrorism suspects  
**Strategic Objective**: Restoration of US predominance in Western Hemisphere

### Operational Outcomes

- Capture of Maduro and Flores
- Neutralization of Venezuelan air defenses
- Deployment of US forces around critical infrastructure
- Implementation of "total and complete" oil quarantine

### Legal Framework

The Trump administration frames this as a law enforcement mission rather than conventional warfare, citing:
- Narcoterrorism indictments
- Presidential inherent constitutional authority
- Protection of hemispheric security interests

---

## The Donroe Doctrine

### Core Principles

The **Donroe Doctrine** represents a 21st-century reassertion of the Monroe Doctrine with updated strategic priorities:

1. **Energy Resource Control**: Direct management of hemispheric oil production
2. **Adversary Exclusion**: Removal of Russian, Chinese, Iranian, and Cuban influence
3. **Institutional Management**: US oversight of "macro-governance" during transition
4. **Economic Reconstruction**: Leveraging energy assets for political reform

### Implementation Mechanisms

- Naval blockades of Venezuelan oil tankers
- Treasury Department control of oil revenue accounts
- Direct appointment of PDVSA board monitors
- Enforcement of diplomatic isolation protocols

---

## Venezuelan Stabilization Roadmap

### Three-Pronged Framework

Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth outlined this strategic approach in closed-door congressional briefings:

#### Phase I: Stabilization

**Timeline**: Immediate (Weeks 1-8)

| Objective | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Neutralize Colectivos (paramilitary groups) | Targeted operations by US forces |
| Restore internal security | 24/7 infrastructure protection |
| Suppress air defenses | Continued military presence |
| Enforce oil quarantine | Naval interdiction operations |

**Status**: Ongoing as of January 11, 2026

#### Phase II: Economic Recovery

**Timeline**: Short-to-Medium Term (Months 2-12)

| Objective | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Reinvigorate energy sector | DOE-led commodity marketing |
| Protect assets from creditors | Executive Order 2026-01 |
| Re-engage international finance | IMF/World Bank negotiations |
| Attract foreign investment | "Clean Slate" approach |

**Key Metrics**:
- $150B total external debt
- $100B infrastructure investment needed
- 30-50M barrels seized crude inventory
- $5B IMF Special Drawing Rights available

#### Phase III: Transition

**Timeline**: Long-Term (12-36 months)

| Objective | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Manage leadership vacuum | Negotiations with Rodríguez administration |
| Sideline hardliners | Conditional support framework |
| Enable free elections | Monitored democratic transition |
| Restore diplomatic relations | Phased embassy reopening |

**Critical Dependencies**:
- Rodríguez cooperation on intelligence dismantling
- Severance of ties with Russia, China, Iran, Cuba
- Expulsion of Cuban security advisors

## Energy Asset Management

### Petro-Governance Framework

Energy Secretary Chris Wright identified Venezuelan oil as the "heart" of the recovery plan. Control of oil sales provides primary leverage for institutional change.

### Executive Order 2026-01

**Issued**: January 9, 2026  
**Purpose**: Shield Venezuelan oil revenue from creditor attachment

**Rationale**: 
> "Unusual and extraordinary threat" posed by $150B in outstanding debt claims that could undermine economic stability during transition

### Financial Overview

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Total Public External Debt** | $150 Billion | Includes bilateral debt with China/Russia and commercial arrears |
| **Seized Crude Inventory** | 30-50 Million Barrels | Sanctioned oil transferred to US control |
| **IMF Special Drawing Rights** | $5 Billion | Proposed conversion for reconstruction |
| **Infrastructure Investment Need** | $100 Billion | Capital required to rebuild energy infrastructure |
| **Current Daily Production** | 800,000-1,100,000 BPD | Down from 3.5M BPD peak (late 1990s) |

### Revenue Management Process

1. **Commodity Marketing**: DOE engages leading marketers and banks
2. **Market Sale**: Venezuelan crude sold at current market prices
3. **Account Holding**: Proceeds held in offshore, US-supervised accounts
4. **Conditional Release**: Funds released when Venezuela deemed "ready"

## Corporate Reentry Analysis

### White House Meeting (January 9, 2026)

President Trump met with 20+ oil executives, promising "total safety" and unprecedented extraction rates.

### Industry Response

#### ExxonMobil: **"Uninvestable"**

**CEO Darren Woods' Assessment**:
- Requires comprehensive hydrocarbons law reform
- Demands legal protections before technical team deployment
- Cites two previous asset seizures as risk factors
- Will not commit capital under current constructs

**Conditions for Entry**:
- 100% foreign ownership allowance
- Bilateral Investment Treaty (BIT) establishment
- Arbitration award resolution mechanism

#### Chevron: **Strategic Advantage**

**Current Position**:
- Only major US firm maintaining operations through Maduro era
- Possesses on-ground infrastructure and expertise

**Capacity Projections**:
- **Immediate**: Double current liftings
- **18-24 Months**: 50% production increase
- **Condition**: Stable security environment

#### ConocoPhillips: **Cautiously Observing**

- Holds $8.7B arbitration award against Venezuela
- Seeking preferential extraction rights as payment offset
- Monitoring legal framework development

### Industry-Wide Concerns

1. **Legal Infrastructure**: Absence of modern hydrocarbons law
2. **Security Environment**: Continued Colectivo activity
3. **Institutional Reliability**: History of asset nationalization
4. **Debt Complexity**: $150B creditor claims creating uncertainty

## Cuban Energy Crisis

### Petro-Vascular Collapse

The term "Petro-Vascular" describes Cuba's oil dependency as analogous to a circulatory system - the abrupt cessation represents a systemic shutdown.

### Crisis Metrics

| Indicator | Data Point | Impact |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| **Venezuelan Supply (2025)** | 26,500-35,000 BPD | Covered 50% of oil deficit |
| **Current Venezuelan Supply** | **ZERO** | Result of US oil blockade |
| **Electricity Generation Deficit** | 1,800-2,000 MW | Nearly half of 3,300 MW demand |
| **Daily Blackout Duration** | 18-20 Hours | Food spoilage, water shortages |
| **Domestic Production** | ~40,000 BPD | Low quality, high sulfur content |
| **Karpowership Buffer** | 25% of generation | Risk of withdrawal over debt |

### Historical Context: Barrio Adentro Agreement

**Framework**: Exchange of Cuban medical/intelligence personnel for subsidized Venezuelan petroleum

**Status**: Effectively terminated with US intervention

**Consequences**:
- Loss of primary energy lifeline
- Medical mission revenue elimination
- Intelligence cooperation disruption

---

## Alternative Supplier Analysis

### Mexico: Limited Humanitarian Aid

**President Claudia Sheinbaum's Position**:
- Describing shipments as "humanitarian aid"
- No increase beyond historical volumes (19,200 BPD average late 2025)
- Avoiding escalation with Trump administration before July USMCA review

**Constraints**:
- US Representative Carlos Giménez monitoring for sanctions triggers
- USMCA renegotiation leverage concerns
- Domestic political considerations

**Supply Entity**: Gasolinas Bienestar (Pemex subsidiary)

### Russia: Strategic Calculus

**Capabilities**: Technical ability to fill Venezuelan gap exists

**Constraints**:
- Ukraine conflict negotiations with US take priority
- Caribbean intervention could jeopardize high-stakes diplomacy
- Tanker seizure precedent (Marinera, January 7, Atlantic)

**Risk Assessment**: Low probability of sustained intervention

### Iran: Domestic Limitations

**Current Cooperation**: Military-technical (drone production)

**Supply Constraints**:
- Domestic subsidy reforms limiting export capacity
- Internal protests reducing government flexibility
- Focus on controlled substances vs. crude oil

**Assessment**: Insufficient capacity for meaningful Cuban grid support

---

## Geopolitical Standoff

### US Ultimatum (January 11, 2026)

**President Trump via Truth Social**:
> "THERE WILL BE NO MORE OIL OR MONEY GOING TO CUBA - ZERO! I strongly suggest they make a deal, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE"

### US Deal Requirements (Inferred)

Based on administration rhetoric and intelligence assessments:

1. **Immediate Withdrawal**: All military and intelligence personnel from Venezuela
2. **Opposition Dismantling**: End support for "Donroe Doctrine" resistance clusters
3. **Economic Reform**: Transition toward market-oriented economic model
4. **Diplomatic Realignment**: Severance of adversarial relationships (Russia, China, Iran)

### Cuban Response

#### President Miguel Díaz-Canel

**Position**: 
> "Cuba is a free, independent, and sovereign nation. The US has no moral authority to dictate our actions."

#### Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez

**Denial of Compensation**: Categorically rejects claims of security service payments

**Rights Assertion**: Absolute right to import fuel from any willing exporter without US subordination

### Intelligence Assessment

**US Intelligence Projection**:
- Cuban regime "well-versed" in managing suffering
- Total oil suspension could push system to "subsistence zone"
- **Timeline**: Potential terminal phase before Q3 2026
- Migration event of unmanageable proportions for Florida/Caribbean

---

## Humanitarian Consequences

### Economic Contraction

- **GDP Decline**: 15% smaller than 2018
- **Tourism**: Less than half of pre-pandemic levels
- **Exodus**: 2.7 million people (record-breaking)
- **Medical Workforce**: 29% reduction since 2021

### Infrastructure Breakdown

**Sanitation Crisis**:
- Waste accumulation in urban centers
- Increased disease vectors (dengue, chikungunya)
- Water system failures

**Grid Collapse**:
- Provinces entering "energy island" stage
- Complete loss of refrigeration
- Industrial production cessation

**Social Services**:
- Hospital backup generator failures
- School closures
- Communication network degradation
